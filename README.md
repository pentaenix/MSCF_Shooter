Game For TagWizz

This game was made by Mateo Saldivar for TagWizz, the game is better played in a 10:16 ratio, so it's recommended to test it in that aspect inside unity
The game contains a level editor, it's a java application made with processing, inside the project there is a PNG image with the instructions on how to use it.
